###### uummata 'population' - In research, the term "population" refers to the total set of individuals, items, or data from which a statistical sample can be drawn. This could be people, animals, objects, or even events, depending on the focus of the study.

For example, if you're conducting a study on the reading habits of university students in Ethiopia, your population would be all university students in Ethiopia. From this population, you would then draw a smaller group (a sample) to participate in your study.

The population in a research study is defined by the research question and objectives. It's important to clearly define your population to ensure that your findings can be accurately generalized to that population.

###### qorannoo seenaa 'historical research' - Historical research is a type of research methodology that involves the examination of past events to draw conclusions and make interpretations about the present. It involves a wide range of sources, including documents, artifacts, archaeological sites, and other archival material.

Historical research can help us understand the sequence of past events, the reasons why these events occurred, and their impact on the present. It's used in various fields such as history, literature, sociology, and even in the sciences.

For example, a historical researcher might study ancient texts to understand the culture and society of that time, or they might examine historical weather patterns to understand climate change.

Remember, the goal of historical research is not just to recite facts and dates, but to ask why and how events happened, and what impact they had.

###### dhabbilee mootummaa 'government institutions' - A government institution, also known as a public institution, is an organization that is established and funded by the government. These institutions are responsible for implementing laws and public policies, providing public services, and maintaining the functioning of the country.

Government institutions can be at various levels - national, regional, or local. They can cover a wide range of sectors, including education, health, defense, infrastructure, and more. For example, Addis Ababa University where you work, Tolemariam, is a government institution as it's funded and regulated by the Ethiopian government.

These institutions play a crucial role in society as they work towards the welfare of the public and the development of the nation. They are accountable to the public and their operations are usually transparent and subject to scrutiny.

###### kaartaa 'map' - In the context of research, a "map" often refers to a visual representation of the relationships between different ideas, concepts, or data. It's a tool that helps researchers organize and structure their thoughts, findings, or the scope of their study.

There are several types of maps used in research:

Concept maps: These illustrate the relationships between different concepts in a graphical format. They're often used in brainstorming or early stages of research to help clarify thoughts.

Mind maps: Similar to concept maps, but they usually start with a central idea and branch out. They're more free-form and less structured.

Data maps: These are graphical representations of data relationships, often used in fields like geography, sociology, or data science.

Process maps: These illustrate the sequence of steps in a process, often used in fields like business or engineering.

Knowledge maps: These are comprehensive diagrams that represent the knowledge in a particular field or discipline.

Remember, the purpose of these maps is to help visualize complex information in a way that's easier to understand and communicate.

###### suuraa 'photo' - In research, a photo, or photograph, can serve as a valuable tool for data collection and analysis. This approach is often referred to as "photographic research" or "photo-elicitation."

Photographs can capture rich, detailed information about a subject, context, or event that might be overlooked or difficult to convey through words alone. They can provide a visual record of a situation, illustrate a particular point, or stimulate discussion.

In some research methodologies, such as ethnography or participatory action research, participants might be asked to take photos that represent their experiences or perspectives. These photos are then used as a basis for discussion and analysis.

In other cases, researchers might analyze existing photographs (historical photos, for example) to gain insights about a particular time period, culture, or phenomenon.

Remember, when using photos in research, it's important to consider ethical issues, such as obtaining consent from people who are identifiable in the photos and respecting privacy and cultural sensitivities.

###### fakkii 'picture' - n research, a "picture" can refer to any visual representation used to illustrate, clarify, or support findings. This could include photographs, diagrams, graphs, maps, or other types of images.

Pictures can serve several purposes in research:

Data Collection: In some research methodologies, pictures are used as a form of data. For example, in visual ethnography, researchers might take pictures to document their observations.

Data Presentation: Pictures can also be used to present data in a more digestible and engaging way. For example, a bar graph or pie chart can provide a clear visual summary of statistical data.

Stimulus Material: In qualitative research, pictures are often used as stimulus material to provoke discussion or reflection. For example, in an interview or focus group, a researcher might show participants a picture and ask them to describe what they see or how it makes them feel.

Documentation: Pictures can serve as a record of the conditions under which the research was conducted. For example, a researcher might take pictures of a lab setup or a field site.

Just like with photos, it's important to consider ethical issues when using pictures in research, such as obtaining necessary permissions and respecting privacy and cultural sensitivities.
